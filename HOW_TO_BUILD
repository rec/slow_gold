1. Create a directory at the root of your file system called /development that
is owned by the user account

2. Download the JUCE and rec repositories.

3. Transfer them to the /development directory

3. cd /development/rec

4. scripts/build_osx.sh

5. Unfortunately, the updated version doesn't put in the icon - I haven't
figured out why this stopped working.  Doing this by hand is trivial.  Find a
version of the application with an icon.  Use the Mac's Command-I to get info.
Click on the icon in the top left hand corner.  Command-C to copy it.  Command-I
on the binary.  Click on the icon in the top left hand corner.  Command-V.

6. To make a demo version, go into the file src/rec/base/DropDead.h and
uncomment line 15:

    // #define DROP_DEAD_DATE 2017, 5, 1

Replace the date by the date you want the program to die on and run steps 3 and
4 again.
